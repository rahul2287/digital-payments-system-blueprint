# Real-Time Payments (RTP) System – Technical Overview

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to understanding the Real-Time Payments (RTP) system architecture, message workflows, network participants, and industry standards.

## 🔍 Overview

Real-Time Payments (RTP) is a modern electronic payment rail that allows the instantaneous transfer of funds between bank accounts. In the U.S., The Clearing House (TCH) RTP network supports 24/7/365 settlement, offering finality and transparency for financial institutions and consumers.

## 📐 RTP System Architecture

Key components of RTP architecture include:
- **Sender Bank (Participant)**
- **Receiver Bank (Participant)**
- **The Clearing House (TCH) RTP Network**
- **Directory Service**
- **Core Banking Integration**
- **Fraud and Risk Systems**
- **Message Queueing and Orchestration Layer**

## 🔄 Standard RTP Workflow

1. **Payment Initiation** – Customer or system triggers payment via digital channel.
2. **Authorization** – Bank validates payer details, balance, and authorization.
3. **Message Transmission** – Bank sends ISO 20022-compliant RTP message to TCH.
4. **Clearing** – TCH validates and routes message to receiving bank.
5. **Settlement** – Instant settlement using pre-funded positions.
6. **Notification** – Both parties receive confirmation with unique transaction ID.
